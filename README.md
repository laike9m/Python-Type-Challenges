## How to Run Locally

You can also run the challenge locally. To do that, clone the project and install necessary dependencies, using either PDM or `requirements.txt`.

[PDM](https://pdm-project.org/) is recommended. After [installing PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/#installation), you can install needed dependencies with the following steps:

```bash
pdm install
pdm dev  # This will run a local Flask server
```

Alternatively, you can install dependencies with `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -X utf8 -m flask run
```

## How to Contribute

- **Add new challenges**

  Adding a new challenge is pretty simple: **you only need to create a new folder, add a `question.py` and a `solution.py`, and that's it**. See [here](docs/Contribute.md) for a detailed guidance.

- **New features & bug fixes**

  If you want to fix a bug or add a new feature, follow the [guidance](docs/Development.md).
